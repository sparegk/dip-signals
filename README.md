# dip-signal-quant

The local dashboard now includes **Exit Research**, **Research Diagnosis** and
**Hypotheses**. It shows profit and downside together, including failed criteria
and negative years. Read [the diagnosis](docs/RESEARCH_DIAGNOSIS.md) and
[proposed next questions](docs/EXP005_PROPOSAL.md); neither defines a validated new
strategy. Start the site with the instructions in [DASHBOARD.md](docs/DASHBOARD.md).

Quantitative research into short-term equity dips and mean-reversion opportunities.
The central question is whether statistically unusual dips and historical bounce
zones predict repeatable rebounds after realistic costs and out-of-sample testing.

This is a research/backtesting project, not investment advice. No strategy or
profitability claim has been validated.

## Current status

Research foundation, validated daily OHLCV ingestion, Parquet caching, a trailing
quantitative feature engine, DipSignal V1 candidates, and initial outcome/backtest
evaluation are deterministically tested.
The initial test universe is AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, GOOGL, and SPY (market
benchmark). V1 flags unusual observations, not buy instructions. The first fixed
specification evaluation, [EXP-001](docs/EXPERIMENTS.md), produced mixed results:
illustrative non-overlapping test trades averaged 0.019% net, with material losses
in some stocks. Profitability and statistically significant baseline outperformance
are not established. [EXP-002 robustness](docs/ROBUSTNESS.md) adds annual historical
folds and 74 usable new stocks from 95 requested current OEF holdings. Its pooled
non-overlapping net mean is 0.510%, but only 36/74 tickers have positive ten-bar
excess means over matched SPY: the predeclared cross-sectional breadth criterion fails. Survivor bias,
21 OHLC data exclusions and negative years/tickers remain documented. Both historical
samples are consumed. Scoring, support and prospective validation remain future work.

The [local quantitative research terminal](docs/DASHBOARD.md) now presents this
evidence, historical signal anatomy, EXP-003 data-quality findings and the verified
paper archive. It is a read-only frontend; live scanning and alerts are still
future work. [Run the site locally](#quantitative-research-terminal).

Core stack: Python, NumPy, pandas, PyArrow/Parquet, yfinance, and pytest. Polars
will be used where processing scale justifies it; later research may use VectorBT,
Numba, scikit-learn/XGBoost, and DuckDB when needed.

## Project layout

- `src/`: data, features, frozen signals, evaluation, robustness and paper archive.
- `frontend/`: React/TypeScript research terminal and UI/browser tests.
- `scripts/`: reproducible research runners, reporting and offline dashboard export.
- `config/`: frozen experiment and collection protocols.
- `tests/`: deterministic tests, with network calls mocked.
- `data/`: generated local datasets, excluded from Git.
- `notebooks/`: exploratory research; `results/`: research artifacts.
- [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md), [research log](docs/RESEARCH_LOG.md),
  [decisions](docs/DECISIONS.md), and [experiments](docs/EXPERIMENTS.md).
- [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md): persistent project instructions.

## Getting started

The checked-in dependency snapshot comes from the existing Windows/Python 3.14
environment and includes platform-specific packages. It is not yet a portable lockfile.
No unrelated dependency versions were changed for the data layer.

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest -q -W error
```

```python
from src.data import get_history, get_histories

aapl = get_history("AAPL")       # Download ten years on first use; otherwise offline cache.
universe = get_histories()        # AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, GOOGL, SPY.
updated = get_history("AAPL", refresh=True)
```

Generated files live in `data/market/` and are excluded from Git. Prices are adjusted;
missing required values raise and are never filled. Existing caches do not refresh
automatically. See [the market-data API and limitations](docs/MARKET_DATA.md) for
date ranges, provenance, storage behavior, and the optional live smoke check.

```python
from src.features import build_features

spy = universe.loc[universe["ticker"].eq("SPY")]
measurements = build_features(universe, benchmark=spy)
```

The [feature guide](docs/FEATURES.md) documents returns, price location, RSI/ATR,
volatility, volume, and benchmark-relative measurements. Features use data through
the current close, retain warm-up NaNs, and contain no trading thresholds. Any
later execution must respect their after-close availability.

```python
from src.signals import build_signals

# SPY supplies market context; classify the non-benchmark stocks here.
candidates = build_signals(measurements.loc[measurements["ticker"].ne("SPY")])
events = candidates.loc[candidates["dip_event_v1"]]
```

[DipSignal V1](docs/SIGNALS.md) uses prior-only ticker-relative percentiles across
four features, requiring complete measurements/history and at least three active
components by default. It exposes condition-days separately from entry events.
The candidate hypothesis has not been validated as a profitable strategy.

The [evaluation guide](docs/BACKTESTING.md) specifies next-open entries, fixed
horizons, barrier exits, costs, censoring, baselines, and uncertainty. Reproduce
EXP-001 offline using the preserved six snapshots in the project environment:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -W error -m scripts.evaluate_v1
```

The runner prints JSON and does not refresh data. Snapshot hashes and exact split
dates are recorded in EXP-001; its historical test partition has now been consumed.

EXP-002 uses frozen configuration in `config/exp002.json`. Run it offline after
preserving/acquiring the required caches:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -W error -m scripts.evaluate_exp002
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m scripts.report_exp002 --check-doc docs/EXPERIMENTS.md
```

See the [robustness guide](docs/ROBUSTNESS.md) for acquisition, exclusions,
membership intervals, replay and future-holdout policy. Generated outputs under
`results/exp_002/` are ignored; static constituents are not point-in-time membership.
The document check uses the preserved EXP-002 artifacts; a rerun at a newer commit
changes recorded execution provenance even when numerical tables reproduce.

EXP-003 audits the 21 OHLC exclusions without repairing data or reevaluating
performance. See the [data-quality findings](docs/DATA_QUALITY_AUDIT.md) and
[universe provenance audit](docs/UNIVERSE_PROVENANCE.md). Frozen EXP-001/EXP-002
inputs and their mixed/negative findings remain unchanged.

The [manual paper-signal archive](docs/PAPER_ARCHIVE.md) preserves full input
vintages, non-events, failures and publication timing under the
[EXP-003 registration](docs/EXP003_PROTOCOL.md). It has no scheduler or outcome
scoring. Signals before the effective session, historical replay, stale inputs
and late runs do not become fresh temporal holdout evidence. Generated archive
and quarantine contents remain ignored under `data/`.

## Quantitative research terminal

The [local research frontend](docs/DASHBOARD.md) makes the existing evidence
explorable: baseline comparisons, annual folds, ticker distributions, concentration,
regimes, signal anatomy, historical outcomes, data-quality exclusions and the manual
paper archive. Failed criteria and negative results remain visible. It does not
collect signals, tune V1 or execute trades.

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m scripts.build_dashboard_data
cd frontend
npm.cmd ci
npm.cmd run dev
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:5173**. The offline exporter reads preserved local research
artifacts; a fresh clone without them shows explicit unavailable states and the
canonical documentation. No demonstration statistics replace missing data.
See [frontend operation and verification](frontend/README.md).

EXP-005 prioritizes fresh evidence. Read [the protocol](docs/EXP005_PROTOCOL.md)
and [daily commands](docs/PAPER_ARCHIVE.md). After 00:15 New York time following
a completed session and before the next open:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -W error -m scripts.collect_prospective
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -W error -m scripts.attach_prospective_outcomes
```

**Prospective Validation** shows coverage and pending outcomes. Returns stay
sealed until registered review gates pass. First signal session: 2026-10-05.
Paper research only; no orders are placed.
