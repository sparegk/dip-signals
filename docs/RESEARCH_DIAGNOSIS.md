# Research diagnosis

## Historical loss foundation, 2026-10-06

See [RISK_MANAGEMENT_RESEARCH.md](RISK_MANAGEMENT_RESEARCH.md) for exact definitions,
MAE distributions, entry-covariate overlap, stopped-then-recovered paths, gap and
regime findings from verified consumed artifacts. This is diagnosis, not fresh
validation. Entry-time losers are not demonstrated to be reliably predictable.
Future-path differences motivate research; they cannot become decision features.
No historical conclusion below, including failed SPY breadth and adaptive downside,
is replaced. Data-quality repair and daily prospective coverage take priority.

## Current next step: EXP-005

Historical evidence → hypothesis → frozen prospective test → fresh evidence.
EXP-005 registers V1's historical exit versus ten-bar holding on the same future
events. Causal ATR tertiles describe volatility; they do not filter trades.
No adaptive optimization or repeated-support rule is promoted. Prospective
outcomes remain pending. See [protocol](EXP005_PROTOCOL.md).

Historical patterns generate hypotheses. Only genuinely prospective records can
provide fresh validation. No rule or parameter changes are authorized here.

## Diagnostic definitions recorded before calculation

The exact definitions are in `config/research_diagnosis.json`. Use the frozen
EXP-002 universe and observations, plus hash-verified EXP-004 artifacts. Preserve
all tickers, losing groups, missing values and original exclusions.

- Components: describe their presence **within existing V1 events**, and the five
  possible exact three/four-component combinations. These are overlapping,
  correlated groups, not independent component-effect estimates.
- Falling knives: group by fixed signal-time momentum, ATR, relative weakness,
  volume and five-observation change in drawdown. Fixed boundaries are descriptive,
  not optimized; missing inputs form an explicit unknown group.
- Timing: inspect the ten-bar path starting at next open. First positive close
  measures time to positive return; first high reaching 2/5/10% measures an
  intraday opportunity, not an executable fill. First maximum high measures time
  to MFE. Require a complete path inside the original fold.
- Entry gap: next open / signal close - 1. This is known **after** the signal and
  cannot be a signal-time filter without a different registered entry protocol.
- Regimes: retain causal EXP-002 SPY 200-day labels; additionally describe fixed
  trailing SPY return, drawdown and volatility bands. No classifier is selected.
- Prior successful dip zone: a same-ticker V1 event in the preceding 365 calendar
  days, whose ten-bar path ended strictly before the current signal, and whose
  highest high reached 5% above its next-open entry. The current close must be
  within 2% of that prior signal's low. Count qualifying visits and their ages.
  Today’s adjusted vintage can revise old price zones. This is a research
  definition, not evidence that support exists; no grid or trading rule follows.
- Stock heterogeneity: descriptive ticker means and correlations with causal
  signal-time inputs. Unequal histories and small samples remain visible.

All new tables are exploratory on consumed historical data. No statistical or
causal claim follows from choosing a favorable subgroup. EXP-001 through EXP-004
remain unchanged. EXP-005 will be proposed separately and will not run here.

Implementation clarification: time to positive MFE is undefined when the full
path has no positive favorable excursion. Twenty-five real paths have zero MFE;
they stay in the timing denominator rather than being mislabeled as a day-one
favorable opportunity. This corrects diagnostic indexing, not a strategy rule.

## Findings — exploratory, generated from verified artifacts

**No validated improvement emerged.** Positive raw rebounds coexist with weak
ticker-level SPY breadth. Exit choice changes risk as well as profit. More
components and repeated prior successful zones do not automatically help.

The recorded revisit group has 1249 complete ten-bar events: gross mean 0.761%, SPY excess -0.070%. The no-known-zone group has gross mean 1.179% and excess 0.359%. This definition does not support the original repeated-support intuition; it is not a reason to tune the zone.

### What the failure modes suggest

- Frequency alone does not establish that V1 is too permissive. EXP-002's condition/frequency rates remain unchanged.
- Exact component combinations differ, but the largest returns are not independent component effects. Some groups are small.
- Strong negative recent momentum is not uniformly worse: deeper dips can also rebound more. A falling-knife filter is not justified.
- High ATR events have larger rebound means **and deeper MAE**. This is a scale/risk relationship, not a free improvement.
- Below-SPY-average events have larger gross mean but lower excess and deeper MAE than above-average events. Regime filtering is unvalidated.
- High relative-volume events have weaker gross/excess means in this description. No volume filter follows.
- Next-open gaps vary with later outcomes, but are future information relative to the original signal. They cannot retroactively filter V1.
- Ticker-average ATR/volatility correlate with return and excess; survivor selection, sample size and market exposure remain confounders.
- EXP-004 isolates exit behavior on the same independent entries. Time-only EV is highest among the primary comparison, but tail risk prevents declaring it superior.
- EXP-001 roughly broke even after costs on its inspected holdout; EXP-002 failed its breadth criterion; EXP-003 exposed data/provenance limits. None is erased by later findings.

### Scorecard and what would count as stronger

Primary: net EV, paired SPY excess and consistency across chronological periods.
Secondary: median, win rate, average win/loss, profit factor, tail loss, ticker
drawdown, MFE capture and frequency. Robustness: positive folds/tickers, equal-ticker
median, concentration and parameter stability. There is no combined score.

Before any future test, define a risk budget and registered acceptable deterioration
relative to V1. A positive EV difference with worse downside is mixed evidence.
Review only at the original archive gates; insufficient fresh evidence remains pending.

Timing fractions include paths that never reached a level; conditional timing
medians include only those that did. MFE includes opportunity after earlier
policy exits. Overlap, adjusted vintages, survivorship and incomplete prior-zone
history prevent causal or prospective claims. Horizon counts differ due to censoring.
